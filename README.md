# Introduction to Ice Sheet Modelling
This repository contains slides and demos for an introduction to ice sheet modelling, delivered at the British Antarctic Survey in Autumn 2024. The course structure is as follows:

## Lecture 1: Ice Sheet Modelling Basics
This lecture will cover:
* What is an ice sheet model?
* What is it used for?
* 'Diagnostic' and 'prognostic' models
* Demonstration: ice velocities in the West Antarctic ice sheet
* How other science, particularly other BAS groups, informs ice sheet modelling
* Policy and society discussion: how do ice sheet models help to inform policy and affect society?

The demo shows:
* a brief introduction to the BAS ice sheet model, [WAVI](https://rjarthern.github.io/WAVI.jl/), and its interface
* how an ice sheet model can be used to calculate how fast the ice is moving, given satellite observations of ice thickness
* how ice speed is affected by ice sheet properties, such as how the ice slides

## Lecture 2: Using ice sheet models to understand tipping points in the cryosphere
This lecture will cover:
* What are tipping-points and tipping-point cascades in the climate system?
* Tipping-points in the cryosphere including the marine ice cliff instability and marine ice shelf instability
* History of understanding of cryosphere tipping-points and the relationship with model improvements
* Demonstration: how ice sheet models can be used to understand the conditions under which tipping points may be passed
* Policy and society discussion: ramifications of tipping points in the cryosphere 

The demo shows:
* an example of the marine ice sheet instability using a low(er) complexity flowline model
* the benefits and drawbacks of such
* how 

## Lecture 3: Process based models and uncertainties in ice sheet model projections
This lecture will cover:
* What is a 'process-based' model?
* Why do we need them?
* The relationship between process based models and uncertainties in ice sheet model projections
* Examples of process based models
* Demonstration: understanding how melting takes place in grounding zones of ice shelves
* Policy and society discussion: uncertainties in projections of sea level rise -- communicating, policy implications

The demo shows:
* an example of a process based model used to understand how melting takes place in grounding zones
