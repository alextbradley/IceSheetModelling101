# Introduction to Ice Sheet Modelling
This repository contains slides and demos for an introduction to ice sheet modelling, delivered at the British Antarctic Survey in Autumn 2024. The course structure is as follows:

## Lecture 1: Ice Sheet Modelling Basics


## Lecture 2: Using ice sheet models to understand tipping points in the cryosphere
This lecture will cover:
* What are tipping-points and tipping-point cascades in the climate system?
* Tipping-points in the cryosphere including the marine ice cliff instability and marine ice shelf instability
* 
* Modelling demonstration, showing how ice sheet models can be used to understand the conditions under which tipping points may be passed
* Discussion on the policy and societal ramifications of tipping points in the cryosphere

## Lecture 3: Process based models
